The only tricky bit is saving - you will need to use ctrl+x AND ctrl-s to save the file.

Additional hints for CLI people:
If using the linux terminal, you might want to consider the following commands.
cd [change directory] - allows you to move from one directory to another. cd /home is a great command.
ls [list] - tells you what files are in the current directory
pwd [print working directory] - tells you which directory you are currently in
cat - displays the file in read-only
nano - displays the file in write
To save a file after nano, use ctrl+x [exit], then y [yes] to confirm, and enter to confirm file name.
